# Security

This is a project aimed at serving the needs of a vulnerable class of people.
Nothing this project achieves will eliminate the responsibilities and duties of
parents and carers. It is hoped however, that it will be reasonably safe to
leave a user of Special Needs Linux with minimal supervision.

## Safe from malware

Without recourse to commercial products, the project will reduce risks from
malicious software. This will probably involve a combination of multiple
security layers:

* Proxies to limit access to low quality/high risk destination
* Regularly (automatically) updated antivirus software with low impact scanning
and realtime protection
* Application whitelisting
* Sandboxing

## Safe from attack

The Special Needs Linux computer should be safe from attack. Some technologies
that may assist with this aim include:

* Well-configured firewall (iptables)
* Host-based intrusion detection/prevention
* Automatic security updates
* Security hardening of the operating system and applications

## Safe from harm

The user of a Special Needs Linux system should be reasonably well protected
from many sorts of harm, whether that be from dangerous or obnoxious websites,
online predators, undesirable/inappropriate adverts, and so on. Contributing to
this might be:

* Privacy features/extensions in the browser
* Configurable ad-blocking
* DNS sinkholing
* Exclusion of inappropriate apps
* Screen time limiting capabilities
