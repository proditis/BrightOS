## Accessibility guidelines

It is not possible to build a *simple* operating system that specilises in
meeting *all* special needs. BrightOS aims to accommodate:

* Fine motor control limitations (e.g. games need not require precise mouse
  movements)
* Mild vision impairment (audible feedback desirable, but not necessarily full
  text-to-speech synthesis)
* Learning difficulties (games involving repetition and very slowly increasing
  difficulty levels help here)

These are not hard-and-fast rules however. Individual games and applications may
not necessarily meet all guidelines.
