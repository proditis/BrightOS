# Introduction

The world of disability is largely unseen - until you are thrust into it. This
is the position my wife and I found ourselves in, in 2004, when she gave birth
to our twins Morgan and James. Due to a [condition during
pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome) our
boys both have profound disabilities. Morgan has severe spastic cerebral palsy,
is quadriplegic and vision impaired. James has severe learning difficulties, is
on the autistic spectrum and suffers from anxiety.

The following years have been a massive learning experience and, I hope,
character building! What has become abundantly apparent is that there are gaps
in the market, for all sorts of specialist provision. And that where specialist
provision *does* exist, applying the label "disabled" or "adapted" to any
product or service reduces its market and increases its cost, dramatically. (A
specialist bath for Morgan comes in at Â£10,000, or thereabouts.)

It does not have to be costly, to meet computing needs. This open source (free!)
repository contains an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook for
customising Linux to help users with learning difficulties. The initial aim of
this project is to create an Ansible build that converts a Linux installation
into something suitable for users (particularly children) with learning
difficulties. Later, we may take a more direct approach, creating a Linux
distribution with installer.

Why Linux rather than Windows? Several reasons:

* **Cost.** Open source licensing allows us to distribute the finished work at
  no cost to end users - who for the reasons above may aleady find their lives
  to be expensive!
* **Simplicity.** Using open source software as a starting point avoids becoming
  bogged down in licensing issues.
* **Familiarity.** I've been using Linux for over twenty years. I've worked with
  developers and picked up knowledge of orchestration and text-based
  configuration. It's much easier for me to achieve this project's goals with
  Linux.

I'm personally most interested in the protection of users with learning
difficulties. So the focus here is on safety and on enabling carers to control
the system for the intended user. Spin-offs or bespoke configuration may be
appropriate, to target other user groups, but that is not my initial objective.

# Goals

Why this playbook? Why this approach?

1. **Accessible fun.** This project should enhance the lives of people who may
   otherwise struggle to use a computer.
2. **Safety.** When preparing a computer environment for vulnerable people,
   their safety is of paramount importance.
3. **Longevity.** Many great, education-focused Linux distributions have started
   well but fizzled out. A low-maintenance strategy is key to survival of a
   project of this nature. An orchestration approach reduces much of the work
   normally associated to maintaining a single-purpose operating system, hence
   Ansible.

# Choice of base OS

To support longevity, it is sensible to choose an open base operating system
with a good track record and long-term prospects. At the same time, to give
end users a degree of choice, it is helpful to select operating systems from
more than one family of Linux. This playbook therefore targets Ubuntu, based on
Debian, and AlmaLinux, based on Red Hat. It may run on other related distros,
but I have not tested that.

# TODO

* Generalise this overall (orchestration) approach to build a reproducible
  framework for *other* primary-purpose operating systems - education, ICS,
  healthcare, etc.
* Build pipelines (CI/CD) to generate downloadable ISOs, for non-technical
  users.

# Sources for other ideas

There are some existing child-friendly Linux distributions. These do not focus
on the needs of users with learning difficulties (a cause dear to my heart) and
many of them suffer from a lack of ongoing maintenance. Nevertheless, they are
very useful sources of inspiration for this project.

* Ubermix: still under active development; focused on children and education
  (but not learning difficulties); has some strong features including "20 second quick
  recovery mechanism"
* Elementary Linux OS: mature, actively developed OS built on Ubuntu/Gnome;
  focused on education and ease-of-use, but not aimed at learning difficulties
* Debian Edu/Skolelinux: a mature project; last release Jul 2019 after a
  two-year hiatus; focus is education rather than learning difficulties
* DoudouLinux: the OS I currently use for my son James (on a machine that is not
  network-connected); apparently abandoned in 2015
* Edubuntu: was a benchmark at one point, but now seems to be obsolete; the
  latest release was in 2016
* Qimo 4 Kids: project officially retired in 2016
* openSUSE-Edu Li-f-e: some good packages and features; project stalled in 2016;
  an[Ubuntu version
  exists](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/Li-f-e/) but its
  future is not clear; not aimed at learning difficulties
* LinuxKidX: last updated in 2016, seems to have been abandoned
* UberStudent: aimed at secondary and higher education; last release 2015
* Educado: particularly interesting due to its inclusion of parental controls;
  last release 2014
* UKnow4Kids: child-friendly Linux; last release was in 2010
* KnoSciences: educational distribution; last release was in 2006
* Leeenux Kids: a child-friendly version of Leeenux, a *non-free* OS that
  specifically targets netbooks (like the Asus Eee PC); less generalised from a
  hardware perspective than most other Linux distributions; documentation about
  Kids version is scant; not focused on learning difficulties
