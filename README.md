Welcome to the BrightOS project, which aims to create a GNU/Linux distribution
suitable for people with learning difficulties. Initially, this is through the
use of an Ansible playbook, applied to a minimal Ubuntu or AlmaLinux
installation.

I encourage you to read about the [Mission](docs/Mission.md).
