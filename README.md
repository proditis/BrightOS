# Special Needs Linux

Ansible playbook for customising Linux to help users with special needs.

## Notes: 12 March 2020

This repository for a project under development. The aim is to
create an Ansible build that converts a Linux installation into something
suitable for users (particularly children) with special needs. Elements to
include, potentially:

* Security hardening
  * AppArmor or SELinux
  * Firewall
* Built-in web proxy for safe surfing (squid + DansGuardian)
* Games & apps
  * KTuberling/Potato Guy
  * GCompris
  * TuxMath
  * KDE Edu Suite
  * Tux Paint
